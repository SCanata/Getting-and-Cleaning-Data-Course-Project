# Code Book for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## Dataset Overview
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset was created from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.

## Files in the Dataset
features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels.
train/subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the training set.
test/subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the test set.

## Variables
Subject: The ID of the test subject
Activity: The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
Time domain signals (prefix Time):
Body Acceleration (e.g., TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean()-X)
Gravity Acceleration (e.g., TimeGravityAccelerometer-mean()-X)
Body Gyroscope (e.g., TimeBodyGyroscope-mean()-X)
Frequency domain signals (prefix Frequency):
Body Acceleration (e.g., FrequencyBodyAccelerometer-mean()-X)

## Data Transformation Steps
Merge Training and Test Sets: Training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
Extract Measurements: Only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.
Use Descriptive Activity Names: Activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive activity names using the activity_labels.txt file.
Label the Data Set with Descriptive Variable Names:
Prefixes t and f were replaced with Time and Frequency to denote time and frequency domain signals.
Acc and Gyro were expanded to Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
Mag was expanded to Magnitude.
BodyBody was corrected to Body.
Create a Tidy Data Set: A second, independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Output
tidy_data_set.csv: The final tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
