# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the R scripts and documentation for the data analysis of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The analysis aims to merge, clean, and summarize the dataset to produce a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Repository Contents
run_analysis.R: The main script that performs the data preparation and then followed by the analysis on the merged data.
CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
README.md: This file, explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
output/tidy_data_set.csv: The output file generated by run_analysis.R, containing the tidy dataset.

#Dataset Description
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A group of 30 volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

#Script Details
run_analysis.R
This script does the following:

Set Up Environment: Prepares the working environment and sets the working directory.
Read Data: Loads the datasets from the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
Merge Data: Combines the training and test datasets to create one data set.
Extract Measurements: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Descriptive Activity Names: Applies descriptive activity names to replace the codes in the dataset.
Label Variables: Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
Create Tidy Dataset: Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and saves it to output/tidy_data_set.csv.

#Prerequisites
R programming language
dplyr package

#How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set the working directory in run_analysis.R script to the location of the cloned repository.
Run the run_analysis.R script in RStudio or a similar R environment.

#Code Book
Refer to the CodeBook.md for detailed information about the dataset, variables, and transformations performed to clean up the data.
